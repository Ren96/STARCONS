# Description
STARCONS is a set of custom buttons inspired by Star Citizen to use with a Stream Deck. 
The Buttons come in a default white color with additional themes based on in-game manufacturers RSI, DRAKE, and Anvil.

The buttons are available in both SVG and PNG (288px) formats and icons are also available with no button border 
making it easy to edit and make your own.

As of release (v1.0) there are currently 129 buttons, This number will continue to grow as more are added in later versions.

STARCONS is constantly being updated with new buttons/icons, 
So if you want me to add a new button please make a request using the discussions page (https://github.com/Ren96/STARCONS/discussions).
